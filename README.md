# JavaScript Drag & Drop With Vanilla JS

This project built for my portfolio to show that I know how to work with [HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)

### [Live Preview](https://codepen.io/saul-gavrilov/pen/vYWGrJB)

### HTML drag & drop API methods that I'm using in this project

- dragstart
- dragenter
- dragleave
- dragover
- drop

The idea of this project is to have a sortable list that we can put into order.
